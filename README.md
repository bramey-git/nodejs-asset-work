# horizon-dev-hw

The goal of this HW is to create a react web app that loads the weekend box office movies from the IMDb API and render it into a table. This table should contain the movie title, rank, gross, and weeks information. Details for how to get the data from IMDb can be found here: https://imdb-api.com/api
